## Discord Communication Guidelines

**When to notify me:**
- ‚úÖ Task completed successfully 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stuck on a problem after multiple attempts
- ü§î Need domain expertise for better solution
- ‚ùå Critical error requiring human decision

**When NOT to ask:**
- Minor issues you can work around
- First attempt at solving something
- Standard debugging processes

**Format:**
- Completion: "‚úÖ [Task] finished - [brief result]"
- Help needed: "ü§î Need input on [specific issue] - tried X, Y, Z approaches"

**Remember:** Work autonomously first, communicate strategically.

This enables async workflows where you can step away (workouts, walks, meetings) while staying informed only when it matters.
