# MCP Discord Agent Communication

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables async communication between AI agents and users via Discord. Perfect for long-running AI tasks where you need remote interaction capabilities.

## üéØ Purpose

This isn't a full Discord bot - it's specifically designed for **AI agents to communicate with users remotely** during long-running tasks. Step away from your machine while your AI assistant handles complex work and reaches out when needed.

## Features

- üì¢ **Send Notifications** - Agent sends updates to Discord channels
- üí¨ **Request User Input** - Agent asks questions and waits for responses
- ‚úÖ **Yes/No Questions** - Simple decision prompts with emoji reactions
- ‚è∞ **Async Communication** - Perfect for long-running tasks requiring remote interaction

## Use Cases

Perfect for scenarios where AI agents need remote human interaction:
- Kick off complex tasks and get notified when they complete
- Let AI ask for your input or feedback when decisions are needed
- Stay in the loop while doing other activities (workouts, walks, meetings)
- Monitor progress without being glued to your screen

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create "New Application" ‚Üí Go to "Bot" ‚Üí "Add Bot"
3. Copy the bot token
4. Enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" in bot settings
5. Use OAuth2 URL Generator to invite bot to your server with these permissions:
   - Send Messages, Read Message History, Add Reactions, View Channels

### 2. Get Channel ID

Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings, then right-click your channel ‚Üí "Copy Channel ID"

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord-agent-comm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-discord-agent-comm"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN": "your-bot-token-here",
        "DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID": "your-channel-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### `discord_send_notification`
```json
{
  "message": "Task completed! üéâ"
}
```

### `discord_request_input`
```json
{
  "question": "What should I name this file?",
  "timeout_seconds": 300
}
```

### `discord_yes_no`
```json
{
  "question": "Deploy to production?",
  "timeout_seconds": 300
}
```

## Agent Instructions

For guidance on how to instruct AI agents to use these tools effectively, see [`AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md). It provides example guidelines for when agents should communicate vs. work autonomously.

## Important Notes

### Discord Notifications
- **Only one device receives Discord notifications** - disable Discord on other devices or turn off notifications if you want them on a specific device
- Notifications work best on mobile devices when other instances are closed

### How It Works
- **Notifications**: Direct message to channel
- **Input requests**: Users reply to the bot's message using Discord's reply feature
- **Yes/No**: Users click ‚úÖ or ‚ùå reactions
- **Default timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot offline**: Check token and permissions
- **No notifications**: Ensure MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT enabled, check channel permissions
- **Timeouts**: Users must reply to messages (not just type in channel) or click reactions

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EugenEistrach/mcp-discord-agent-comm.git
cd mcp-discord-agent-comm
bun install
cp .env.example .env  # Edit with your tokens
bun run dev
```
