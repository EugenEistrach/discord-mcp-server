## Configuration

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["discord-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN": "your-bot-token-here",
        "DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID": "your-channel-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can also use a `.env` file in your project:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id-here
```

## Usage

Once configured, the following tools are available in your MCP client:

### Send a Notification

```typescript
await discord_send_notification({
  message: "Task completed successfully! üéâ"
});
```

### Ask for User Input

```typescript
const response = await discord_request_input({
  question: "What should I name this file?",
  timeout_seconds: 60  // Optional, defaults to 60
});

// Response: { success: true, response: "user_data.json" }
```

### Ask a Yes/No Question

```typescript
const answer = await discord_yes_no({
  question: "Should I deploy to production?",
  timeout_seconds: 30  // Optional, defaults to 60
});

// Response: { success: true, result: true }
```

## How It Works

1. **Notifications**: Simply sends a message to the configured Discord channel
2. **User Input**: 
   - Bot sends a message asking for input
   - Users click "Reply" on the message and type their response
   - Bot waits for the reply (up to timeout)
   - Returns the user's response or times out
3. **Yes/No Questions**:
   - Bot sends a message with ‚úÖ and ‚ùå reactions
   - User clicks one of the reactions
   - Bot returns true for ‚úÖ, false for ‚ùå

## Development

### Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-mcp-server.git
cd discord-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your bot token and channel ID

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run the test script
npm test

# Or test individual functions
npm run test:notify
npm run test:input
npm run test:yesno
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot is not responding
- Check that the bot is online in your Discord server (should show as online in member list)
- Verify the bot has permissions in the channel
- Check the channel ID is correct
- Ensure MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled in Discord Developer Portal

### Timeout errors
- The default timeout is 60 seconds
- Users must reply to the specific message (using Discord's reply feature)
- For yes/no questions, users must click the reaction, not type a response

### Permission errors
- Ensure the bot has all required permissions in the channel
- The bot needs to be able to see the channel, send messages, and add reactions
